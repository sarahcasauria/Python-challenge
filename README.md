# Python-challenge
This repository contains all data corresponding to the Data Analytics Bootcamp Python Challenge homework.

## PyBank
In this challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyRoll
In this challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process by creating a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
